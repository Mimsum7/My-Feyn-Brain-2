# File Processing Implementation Guide

## FileReader API (✅ Already Implemented)

The **FileReader API** is a built-in browser API that doesn't require installation. It's perfect for reading text files.

### What it does:
- Reads file contents in the browser
- Supports multiple formats (text, binary, data URLs)
- Asynchronous operation with Promise support

### Current implementation:
```javascript
const readTextFile = (file: File): Promise<string> => {
  return new Promise((resolve, reject) => {
    const reader = new FileReader();
    
    reader.onload = (event) => {
      const result = event.target?.result;
      if (typeof result === 'string') {
        resolve(result);
      } else {
        reject(new Error('Failed to read file as text'));
      }
    };
    
    reader.onerror = () => {
      reject(new Error('Error reading file'));
    };
    
    reader.readAsText(file, 'UTF-8');
  });
};
```

## Additional Libraries Needed

### For PDF Files
```bash
npm install pdf-parse @types/pdf-parse
```

### For DOCX Files
```bash
npm install mammoth
```

## Current Status

- ✅ **TXT files**: Fully working with FileReader API
- ⚠️ **PDF files**: Requires pdf-parse library installation
- ⚠️ **DOCX files**: Requires mammoth library installation

## Next Steps

1. **Test TXT files**: Upload a .txt file to see the real FileReader API in action
2. **Install PDF support**: Run `npm install pdf-parse @types/pdf-parse`
3. **Install DOCX support**: Run `npm install mammoth`
4. **Uncomment real implementations** in the code where marked with TODO comments

## FileReader API Methods

- `readAsText()`: Reads file as text string (what we're using)
- `readAsDataURL()`: Reads file as data URL (base64)
- `readAsArrayBuffer()`: Reads file as ArrayBuffer
- `readAsBinaryString()`: Reads file as binary string

The FileReader API is perfect for text files and provides the foundation for all file processing in the browser!
