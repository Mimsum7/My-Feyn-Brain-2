Factors Affecting Photosynthesis 
Photosynthesis process requires several factors such as: 
● Light Intensity: Increased light intensity results in a higher rate of photosynthesis. On the 
other hand, low light intensity results in a lower rate of photosynthesis. 
● The concentration of CO2: Higher concentration of carbon dioxide helps in increasing 
the rate of photosynthesis. Usually, carbon dioxide in the range of 300 – 400 PPM is 
adequate for photosynthesis. 
● Temperature: For efficient execution of photosynthesis, it is important to have a 
temperature range between 25° to 35° C. 
● Water: As water is an important factor in photosynthesis, its deficiency can lead to 
problems in the intake of carbon dioxide. The scarcity of water leads to the refusal of 
stomatal opening to retain the amount of water they have stored inside. 
● Pollution: Industrial pollutants and other particulates may settle on the leaf surface. This 
can block the pores of stomata which makes it difficult to take in carbon dioxide.
